# Keklang

A static analysis language to create C or 
possibly any other code.

## Goal

The goal is a simple but powerful language, that allows for 
structured meta-programming and static analysis.
So there are two modes to the language: The code that is transpiled 
and the script code that transpiles the code.
One syntax for both.
Web-based ide for super easy code analysis.

## Roadmap

- Get the language semantics and basic inner workings done
- program some example code
- finalize the syntax
- Create a web-based ide
- Compile first to lua code (for example a lÃ¶ve 2d game)
- revisit the syntax and functions
- Create a C -kek bytecode interpreter/compiler
- Compile to C code -> sdl2 game
